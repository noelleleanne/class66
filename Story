Carlos made spaghetti, and now he spilled the spaghetti on the floor
He didnt want to clean it up so he made Sarah do it
Sarah didntt want to clean it up so she made Chelsea do it
Chelsea didnt want to clean it up so she asked Carlos to do it
Carlos didnt want to clean it up so he just left it on the floor
When Sarah came back later she slipped on the spill
Sarah got mad at Chelsea for not cleaning the spill
Chelsea got mad at Carlos and then they are all sad and mad
